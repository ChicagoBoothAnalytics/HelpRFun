# HelpRFun by Chicago Booth Analytics Club

This repo is developed and maintained by members of the Analytics Club at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

The repo contains miscellaneous "helper" R functions (hence the name "**HelpRFun**") and custom data structures that are useful for a wide variety of R programming tasks.

This is also a fun medium for our Analytics Club members to learn and practice the following:

* General R programming;
* Version control via Git and GitHub;
* Packaging and distributing an R package; and
* Co-programming and co-governing a shared software development project in general.
